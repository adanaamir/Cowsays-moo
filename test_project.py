# Since user_choice() relies on user input, we'll need to mock this input.
#mocking means instead of typing any values, youre telling python that user has typed this eg "yes" and "1" in this case
# this was achieved by using patch that replaced the normal input() wiht a fake one that gave python yes and 1 repsonse
#in mocking, the numbe rof inputs in your function should match the inputs you provide
